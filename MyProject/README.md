gefgwt-myproject
================

The gefgwt.org Getting Started project taken further.

This project is the one that is created when you follow the instructions in the Getting Started section on http://gefgwt.org.

Putting it here makes it easy to collaboratively improve it by adding a Tool Palette and tool icons, for example.

I have had problems getting this code working fully by cloning it into a GWT-equipped Eclipse, adding jar files from a fresh GWT project.
So I succeeded going the other way around instead - I started with doing the getting started tutorial and then moved in some xml, some java files and then Run as web app.
